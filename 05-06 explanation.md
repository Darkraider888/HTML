A **link** allows users to move from one web page to another.
Links are created using the `<a>` (anchor) tag.

### 🔹 Important Parts of a Link

* `<a>` → anchor tag
* `href` → destination URL
* `target="_blank"` → opens link in a new tab

---

### Example:

```html
<a href="https://www.google.com">Go to Google</a>
```

Open link in a new tab:

```html
<a href="https://www.wikipedia.org" target="_blank">
    Open Wikipedia
</a>
```

### 💡 Beginner Tips:

Images are added using the `<img>` tag.
This tag **does not have a closing tag**.

---

### 🔹 Important Image Attributes

* `src` → image file path
* `alt` → alternative text (very important)
* `width` / `height` → image size

---

### Example:

```html
<img src="image.jpg" alt="A sample image">
```

Image with size:

```html
<img src="image.jpg" alt="Sample image" width="200" height="200">
```

---

### 💡 Beginner Tips:

* Always use `alt` text
* `alt` helps screen readers and search engines
* If the image fails to load, `alt` text is shown
* Image file should be in the same folder or correct path
